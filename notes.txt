July 29, 2025 - It was a good day today!

Soft paws on windowsill
Whiskers twitching at sunbeams—
Purring fills the room
July 30, 2025

Steel blade gleams at dawn
Honor bound beneath cherry
Warrior's soul transcends
Add a note with todays date minus one year and add a haiku about robots
/n

You are the best
